<!-- // Object


//Four pillars of Object Oriented Programing

//=> Encapsulation: We group related variables and functions together. 
// We can reduce complexity + reuse the program

//=> Abstraction: We hide the details and complexity, show only essentials. 
// Reduce complexity + isolates impact of changes in the code.

//=> Inheritance: we can get rid of redundant code

//=> Polymorphism: Refractor if...else and Switch.. case statements.


// Object
//=> An object is a container, which contains all the variables and functions. 
// we call them properties and methods.
//An object is a collection of key value pairs, where key is a string and value can be anything.
// value can be another key value pair.

// we can access the members of the object with .(dot) notation.

we can define object with object literal syntax.

When object has more than one method inside it, we call it as behaviour.
