// Object


//Four pillars of Object Oriented Programing

//=> Encapsulation: We group related variables and functions together. 
// We can reduce complexity + reuse the program

//=> Abstraction: We hide the details and complexity, show only essentials. 
// Reduce complexity + isolates impact of changes in the code.

//=> Inheritance: we can get rid of redundant code

//=> Polymorphism: Refractor if...else and Switch.. case statements.


// Object
//=> An object is a container, which contains all the variables and functions. 
// we call them properties and methods.
//An object is a collection of key value pairs, where key is a string and value can be anything.
// value can be another key value pair.
